## History of Web

# Web 1.0

1. Internet is started in 1970s, so the webpages were static (Only Readable)
2. No Interaction (no writing)

# Web 2.0

1. Now, the webpages become dynamic (Read and Write and so on..)
2. The webpages are user interactive (not only consume, also can create, share, connect)
3. Useful for Community Building, sharing and collaboration
4. But the user data in every website (or company) is used for internal purposes.

# Web 3.0
1. Future websites will be built on blockchain technology and decentralization
2. Data is no longer in single company server, but distributed accross many companies
3. Users own their data and can also earn via tokens, NFTs
Ex: Cryptocurrencies, decentralized Apps, Metaverse Project

## How Computers communicate

1. Any device that connects to internet will receive an IP(Internet Protocol) Address from the Internet Service Provider (ISP), can be used for communication.
2. To communicate, computers need to follow few rules named Protocals
3. During communication, Data is sent in form of small chunks called Data Packets
4. These Packets travel via wifi, cables, satellites
5. They are sent to nearest Tower, then Tower to ISP provider (jio, airtel).
6. Now ISP checks the IP address, but packets can provide only domain name. 
7. ISP checks with the DNS (DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM) server for the IP address of that domain.
8. and ROUTE it to that destination (if international, via under water cables - optical fibres).

## Domain Name, IP & MAC address, Routing:

1. Domain name is a human friendly way to access websites instead of remembering website's address.
2. IP address, UNIQUE NUMBER alloted to a device by the ISP to communicate accross the world.
3. MAC address (MEDIA ACCESS CONTROL), UNIQUE NUMBER present in a device for the identification to communicate on WIFI or LAN.
4. Routing, decide the fastest network and safest path for the data packets to travel
